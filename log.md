# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 (R1D1): December 30, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator - Stand in Line)
2. I started a Codewars account, and took on a challenge.
3. I also needed a refresher of GitHub (Git and Command Line), so I worked through some tutorials - used the command line to create a repo, commit and push some changes.

**Thoughts**: 

I planned on starting my code challenge on January 1st, but, I had time this morning, so I jumped on in.  My initial thought is that I jumped in without a plan. In order to be successful, I will spend some time writing down my goals, and some possible projects to work on during the remaining 99 days of the challenge.
