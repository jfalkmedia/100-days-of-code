# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 (R1D1): December 30, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator - Stand in Line)
2. I started a Codewars account, and took on a challenge.
3. I also needed a refresher of GitHub (Git and Command Line), so I worked through some tutorials - used the command line to create a repo, commit and push some changes.

**Thoughts**: 

I planned on starting my code challenge on January 1st, but, I had time this morning, so I jumped on in.  My initial thought is that I jumped in without a plan. In order to be successful, I will spend some time writing down my goals, and some possible projects to work on during the remaining 99 days of the challenge.

### Day 2 (R1D2): December 31, 2017 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Understanding Boolean Values - Counting Cards)
2. Refactored all if/else statements to use switch statements until it clicked.
3. Started converting static HTML site to Wordpress custom theme.

**Thoughts**: 

My code refresher is proving to be like riding a bicycle (yay!). When I first learned JavaScript, switch statements were something I ignored. For some reason they never made sense to me, but today I made it click! After playing around with some JavaScript, I jumped over to WordPress, and started converting a static HTML prototype into a custom WordPress theme. I did get stuck a few times, and could feel my frustration laughing at me, but I kept pushing through and figured everything out!

### Day 3 (R1D3): January 01, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Build JavaScript Objects - Accessing Nested Arrays)
2. Worked on WordPress theme (header, footer, sidebar, nav)

**Thoughts**: 

Today was a bit slower moving than yesterday. Probably can blame New Year's Eve (hehe). JavaScript objects are fun. The WordPress theme is starting to come together. I began converting static elements into WordPress functions. When I get frustrated I tend to also get sloppy. My goal is to keep writing clean code even when I'm frustrated.
