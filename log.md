# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 (R1D1): December 30, 2017 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator - Stand in Line)
2. I started a Codewars account, and took on a challenge.
3. I also needed a refresher of GitHub (Git and Command Line), so I worked through some tutorials - used the command line to create a repo, commit and push some changes.

**Thoughts**: 

I planned on starting my code challenge on January 1st, but, I had time this morning, so I jumped on in.  My initial thought is that I jumped in without a plan. In order to be successful, I will spend some time writing down my goals, and some possible projects to work on during the remaining 99 days of the challenge.

### Day 2 (R1D2): December 31, 2017 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Understanding Boolean Values - Counting Cards)
2. Refactored all if/else statements to use switch statements until it clicked.
3. Started converting static HTML site to Wordpress custom theme.

**Thoughts**: 

My code refresher is proving to be like riding a bicycle (yay!). When I first learned JavaScript, switch statements were something I ignored. For some reason they never made sense to me, but today I made it click! After playing around with some JavaScript, I jumped over to WordPress, and started converting a static HTML prototype into a custom WordPress theme. I did get stuck a few times, and could feel my frustration laughing at me, but I kept pushing through and figured everything out!

### Day 3 (R1D3): January 01, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Build JavaScript Objects - Accessing Nested Arrays)
2. Worked on WordPress theme (header, footer, sidebar, nav)

**Thoughts**: 

Today was a bit slower moving than yesterday. Probably can blame New Year's Eve (hehe). JavaScript objects are fun. The WordPress theme is starting to come together. I began converting static elements into WordPress functions. When I get frustrated I tend to also get sloppy. My goal is to keep writing clean code even when I'm frustrated.

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I took some JavaScript challenges via freeCodeCamp (Iterate with JavaScript For Loops - Profile Lookup)
2. Worked on WordPress theme (converted homepage to dynamically generate content using custom fields, started working on page templates)

**Thoughts**: 

I could have been less distracted while coding, but I was still able to figure out all my challenges. Tomorrow's goal: I'm going to finish the Basic JavaScript section via freeCodeCamp. I also spent some time working on the WordPress theme. Began making use of custom fields on the home page. Makes the site nice and clean.

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I worked through some challenges in freeCodeCamp (Condense arrays with .reduce - Check for Palindromes)

### Day 12 (R1D12): January 10, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I worked through a challenge in freeCodeCamp (Find the Longest Word in a String), and did some more work on the WordPress theme

**Thoughts**: 

Whenever I hit a roadblock today, I broke down the problem into smaller chunks, and worked out what I had to do in my head before executing. I also made more use of the Developer Tools Console in Chrome. Seemed to help me solve problems much faster (and with less frustration)

### Day 13 (R1D13): January 11, 2018 - Thursday (-)

**Today's Progress**: 
No progress - the day did not present itself with any opportunity for extra code.

**Thoughts**: 

I don't feel defeated that I only made it 12 days straight. I decided to continue counting. I've added in a (-) symbol to signify the days I did not get to code. Hopefully there won't be too many days where I need to add it! Onward.

### Day 14 (R1D14): January 12, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Today was a WordPress day, so PHP
2. Also some CSS

**Thoughts**: 

Today I spent some time making my theme more dynamic by giving some pages some custom fields. I also found a few ways to execute my CSS a bit more simply. Trying to be smarter and cleaner about how I code. I'm often pressed for time, and that causes me to rush. Slow down Jaclyn.
